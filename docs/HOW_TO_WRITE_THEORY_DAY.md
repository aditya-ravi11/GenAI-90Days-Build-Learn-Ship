# How to Write a Great Theory Day

**Minimum Deliverables**
1. `README.md` with: objectives, TL;DR, key concepts, one diagram, one formula, one takeaway.
2. `notes.ipynb` with 2-4 short cells mixing text and tiny code checks.
3. `tiny_demo.py` with a 20–40 line sanity-check experiment.
4. `references.bib` or links in README.

**Checklist**
- [ ] Clear question(s) you answered today
- [ ] Claims supported by a micro-experiment or derivation
- [ ] Repro steps (`python tiny_demo.py`)
- [ ] 3–5 bullet takeaways
